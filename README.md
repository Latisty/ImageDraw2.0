My block creator has finally been finished.
Thanks to Nudy for helping me test.
Most importantly, dont just use the block creator to copy images, but instead use it to transfer art you made from editors with awesome art tools into Pr3!
I made this because I love to see well designed levels, and I want to make that easier.

Instructions will be below.
Windows 64bit only for now.

main program is in release called Imagedraw.exe.

WARNINGS:
Make sure to finalize your blocks and stamps
DO NOT resize pr3 or change editor zoom.
Make sure your screen resolution is 100%.

Please report any bugs.
If the gui is too demanding I can make a lighter version.

Omicron's per-pixel algorithm selection not set-up yet.
